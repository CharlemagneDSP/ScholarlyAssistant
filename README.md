# ScholarlyAssistant
Create and query a database that draws from all the PDFs in a directory.

Put both CreateDatabase.py and ScholarlyAssistant.py in the same directory. They don't need to be in the target directory. In CreateDatabase.py, replace "D:/My Vault/Scholarly  Resources/Viking History Books" with the path to your target directory. Run CreateDatabase.py first, then run ScholarlyAssistant.py when it's done.
